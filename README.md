The Happy New Year week continues! Here we have another roundup of some of the best tips and tricks for the Terminal from 2018, this time aimed at more advanced Mac users who spend a lot of time at the command line. Many command line tips are just general unix tips, thus a fair amount of these tricks not only work on Mac OS but also on Linux too. If you enjoyed our other roundups for best tips for iPhone and iPad from 2018 and best tips for Mac from 2018, and you’re a Terminal user, you’ll probably enjoy this tip roundup too.
